### Spark Fly
#### A 2d Multiplayer Game For Nerds LIKE YOU

### Why am I making this?
Well I wanted to make a 2d game that I could play with my friends. I always tried to find good games to play online but I couldn't find one that I liked and Enjoyed. I just want a multiplayer game with a lot of fun and a lot of people and a lot of particle effects, A lot of motion, a lot of guns and especially missiles.

So I am gonna start making it today. I will upload the videos on Youtube and I will also upload the source code on Github.

### Game Engine 
I made my own game engine recently that was called sword engine, but that lack of features and support. So I am gonna use a better engine with a lot of features and support. So, I am using phaser game engine for this project.


- Read me will be updated soon.

Logs:

- 27 Jan 2021: Socket integration - Starting of Server Side Code, Live Positioning
- 28 Jan 2021: Nothing Much, But Changed The Strcutre of the code and Implemented the new Style to make it more manageable.
- 29 Jan 2021: More Than 2 Ships, Live Bullets Firing, Collision Detection, and Health Reduction - Ready To Be Deployed on The Real Server And Actually Deployed on Glitch

Right Now, The Project is live on : https://ggsparkflygame.web.app/ , It's playable but it's laggy because glitch is free and it's not a perfect server for a multiplayer game. I will try to figure out the server problems soon, for now I consider my first multiplayer game to be done. In Future I'll be making more games.
